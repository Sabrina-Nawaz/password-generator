# password-generator

## Description

Creating passwords online can seem like a headache, but for the protection of your safety and security online, the Password Generator was created as a web application in which you can generate safe and secure passwords with multiple options/criterias offered. 

## Usage

When you click on the "Generate Password" button, you will be met with multiple prompts and confirmations for the criterias you select for your password. It will then generate a random password between 8 - 128 characters, depending on the length you have entered.

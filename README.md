# Password Generator

## Description

Creating passwords online can seem like a headache, but for the protection of your safety and security online, the Password Generator was created as a web application in which you can generate safe and secure passwords with multiple options/criterias offered. 

## Usage

When you click on the "Generate Password" button, you will be met with multiple prompts and confirmations for the criterias you select for your password such as lowercase, uppercase, special and numerical characters. It will then generate a random password between 8 - 128 characters, depending on the length you have entered and criterias you have selected.
